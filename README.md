## Description
The JavaScript capstone project  is about building your own web application based on an external API. You will select an API that provides data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it.

## Requirements

### APIs
- First, you need to find an API so you can base the development of the webapp around it. The API should allow you to:
  - Get a list of items with a unique item id (or generate the unique id).
  - For a given item, get detailed information about it.
- You will use our [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) to record the different user interactions (likes, comments and reservations).

### Interfaces
- You should build these interfaces:
  - The home page.
  - The comments popup.
- You should follow the layout of the wireframes provided. You should personalize the rest of the design including colors, typographies, spacings, etc.
- Home page
  - When the page loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
    - The selected API and shows the list of items on screen.
    - The Involvement API to show the item likes.
  - Remember that your page should make only 2 requests:
    - One to the base API.
    - And one to the Involvement API.
  - When the user clicks on the Like button of an item, the interaction is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.
  - When the user clicks on the "Comments" button, the Comments popup appears.
  - Home page header and navigation similar to the given mockup.
  - Home page footer similar to the given mockup.
- Comments popup
  - When the popup loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
    - The selected API and shows details about the selected item.
    - The Involvement API to show the item comments.
  - When the user clicks on the "Comment" button, the data is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.

### Counters
Counters We have counters in all the interfaces that show:
- The number of items (home).
- The number of comments (comments popup).

### Technical set up
- Set up the repository on GitHub and use Gitflow.
- Set up webpack.
- Set up a JavaScript testing library (Jest).
